# Cumulative Probability Drop Calculator

This Python script calculates the cumulative probability of obtaining an item drop in games or similar systems. It uses the cumulative property of probability to determine the likelihood of achieving at least one success over multiple attempts.

### How It Works

The script prompts you to input:
1. **Number of base items**: The number of attempts youâ€™ll make.
2. **Drop rate percentage**: The chance of success per attempt (e.g., 32% for 32% chance).

Based on these inputs, the script calculates:
- The probability of obtaining the item at least once.
- The number of attempts needed to reach 50%, 75%, 90%, and 99% success rates.

At the end, the script will ask if you got the item and display your actual success rate.

### Example Usage 

1. **Input values**:
    - Number of base items: x
    - Drop rate percentage: x

2. **View results**:
    - See the probability of getting the item with your inputs.
    - See attempts needed to reach specific success rates.
    - Confirm if you got the item and your success rate.
