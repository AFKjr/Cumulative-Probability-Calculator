# Cumulative-Probability-Calculator
Simple Cumulative Probability Calculator

This Python script calculates the cumulative probability of obtaining an item drop in games or similar systems. Itâ€™s based on the cumulative property of probability, which determines the likelihood of achieving at least one success over multiple attempts. 

### How It Works

The script prompts the user to input:
1. The **number of base items** they have (i.e., the number of attempts).
2. The **drop rate percentage** for the final item (e.g., `32` for a 32% chance per attempt).

Using these inputs, the script calculates the probability of getting at least one drop based on the cumulative probability formula:
\[
P(\text{at least one success}) = 1 - (1 - p)^n
\]
where:
- \( p \) is the drop rate for a single attempt,
- \( n \) is the number of attempts.

### Example Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python CPC.py
    ```

2. **Input values**:
    - When prompted, enter the number of base items you have (e.g., `50`).
    - Enter the drop rate percentage (e.g., `32`).

3. **View the result**:
    The script will output the cumulative probability of obtaining the item at least once.

### Example

For a scenario where you have 50 base items and a 32% drop rate:
